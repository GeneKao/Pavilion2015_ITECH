[ICD/ITKE Research Pavilion 2015-16 Development and Implementation Demo](https://www.geneatcg.com/icditke-research-pavilion-2015-16-development-and-implementation-demo/)

I was in the computational design team while designing the [ICD](https://icd.uni-stuttgart.de/?p=16220)/[ITKE](https://www.itke.uni-stuttgart.de/archives/portfolio-type/icditke-research-pavilion-2015-16-2) Research Pavilion 2015-16 and was mainly in charge of developing computational tools.

Here is the demonstration video to show the geometrical implementation. One of the input parameters from the plugin is a mesh surface, and the output parameters are all tree data structure thus some double-layer light weight structure as well as some planar plates can be generated (Planar plate wasnâ€™t realized due to the decision making and scheduling during the development). All the geometries are labeled in the right sequence so they can be fabricated directly:

The demo video above shows the workflow from mesh to pavilion geometry by using our customised Grasshopper component, and we can select vertices from the mesh by using [Selectable Preview](https://www.food4rhino.com/app/selectable-preview) plugin. Finally, the customised component can generate plate and double layer topology seamlessly.

Some part of the code is on my [GitHub](https://github.com/GeneKao/Pavilion2015_ITECH) and the code project was developed together with Julian Wengzinek, Thu Nguyen-Phuoc and Long Nguyen.

The pavilion project video from the design development to the fabrication process can be seen in the video from ICD/ITKE here:
